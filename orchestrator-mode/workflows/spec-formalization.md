# Pre-dispatch spec formalization

For non-trivial features. Skip the whole flow only when work is mechanical, a follow-up fix for a specific reviewer blocker, or docs-only.

```
1. BRAINSTORM (≥2 voices)
2. WRITING PLAN  (Claude /superpowers:writing-plans on brainstorm output)
3. COUNSELORS    (one coordinator agent runs the panel; orchestrator gets ONE doc)
4. SYNTHESIZE    (orchestrator reads consensus + unique insights, revises plan)
5. DISPATCH IMPL
```

When in doubt, run the cycle. 30-min spec cost ≪ 1-day wrong-impl cost.

## 1. Brainstorm — must be multi-voice

Single-agent brainstorm output is acceptable ONLY as preamble feeding into the dialogue. Final brainstorm scratchpad must show ≥2 voices. Acceptable patterns:

- **a) Parallel + synthesize.** Spawn 2 agents (different families, e.g. Claude + Codex) with same prompt. Each writes its own scratchpad. A third synthesizer agent reads both, has them iterate (≤3 rounds), produces final scratchpad.
- **b) Adversarial pair.** Spawn agent A with `/superpowers:brainstorming`. Spawn adversarial agent B (different family) to challenge A's sketch and produce the synthesized brainstorm.

## 2. Writing-plans

Spawn a Claude solo delegate that runs `/superpowers:writing-plans` on the brainstorm output. Produces ordered phases, file list, acceptance criteria, rollout gate.

## 3. Counselors coordinator

Spawn ONE Claude coordinator. The coordinator owns the panel + synthesis so the orchestrator gets ONE consolidated document. Coordinator brief instructs:

1. Spawn panel in parallel: Claude (deep reasoning), Codex (impl pragmatics), Gemini (dissent).
2. Brief each panelist with the [Multi-reviewer brief template](#multi-reviewer-brief-template). Each writes to a unique durable scratchpad (e.g. `review/plan-<topic>-<agent>-r<round>`) via your transport.
3. Harvest verdicts (Pattern C — coordinator is panel's orchestrator, not the main one). Sub-agents push terminal events to their coordinator via transport-specific push signals.
4. Synthesize into a consolidated scratchpad (e.g. `counselors/plan-<topic>`) with sections: Per-panelist verdict / Consensus blockers (≥2 voices) / Unique insights (one voice) / Recommended next step (DISPATCH IMPL / PATCH PLAN / REJECT-AND-REWRITE) / Consensus matrix.
5. Push a signal to the main orchestrator with summary + scratchpad slug. Sentinel: `COUNSELORS DONE: <verdict>`.

"Counselors" = user-vocab for the panel.

Design intent: main orchestrator gets ONE doc not N; coordinator can iterate the panel mid-stream; Pattern C wakes orchestrator once not N times.

## 4. Synthesize

Read consensus blockers + unique insights. Revise plan (directly or via another Claude delegate). If changes are substantial, loop back to step 3 for r2 (typically Claude + Codex only on r2; full panel only on r1 unless major plan rewrite).

## When to skip

- Mechanical work (rename across files, agreed-upon fix).
- Follow-up fixes for a specific reviewer blocker (the blocker IS the spec).
- Docs-only work that doesn't change behaviour.

## Multi-reviewer brief template

```text
You are one of several independent reviewers of an implementation plan.
Do NOT coordinate with other reviewers. Do NOT produce a "balanced" view.
Your job is to be adversarial and find what the plan misses.

## Plan
<paste plan OR reference solo scratchpad slug>

## Your job
1. Read end-to-end. Check against project spec / reality.
2. Find: missing requirements, wrong assumptions, over-engineering,
   unstated dependencies, test gaps, rollback gaps, ops concerns.
3. Produce a structured verdict:
   - BLOCKERS (plan ships broken)
   - MISSING (omits something the spec requires)
   - OVER-SCOPED (does work we shouldn't)
   - ALTERNATIVES (different approaches worth considering)
   - UNIQUE INSIGHT (your distinctive angle)

## Output
Write verdict to a unique durable scratchpad (e.g. `plan-<topic>-review-<your-agent-name>`) via your transport. Print `DONE` and the scratchpad slug. Nothing else.

## Rules
- No consensus-seeking. No hedging. State your position plainly.
- File paths + line numbers for every concrete finding.
- Even if the plan is basically right, find one thing worth stress-testing.
```
